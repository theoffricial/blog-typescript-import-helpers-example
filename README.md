# Demonstrating how TypeScript "importHelpers" works

## How to get value from this repo 💎

1. Follow the blog-post, here

1. 🏗️ Install dependencies

```
npm ci
```

1. The `dist` files already exists in the project, you can check the differences between "with" and "without" the `importHelpers` flag, or you can run `build` yourself if you don't trust me 😜.

1. See lines of code differences by run

99 vs 37 😳

```
npm run linesOfCode

<!-- result -->

NO importHeleprs lines of code: 99
importHelper lines of code: 37
```
